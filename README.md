## Introduction 

This project focuses on the bike share business of the famous bike chare company [Capital Bike Share](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/). The main goal here is to work with some previous data, analyse it following time series prediction and finally publish it using Heroku based on a machine learning model. 

## The data:
All the data used in this project are included in the respective folders. The data was collected from the capital bike share website where they publish their bike ride data with every one. There are data from two different timeframe 2011-12, and 2018-19-20. Al the data included in this project are in .csv format. 

## 2011-12 Analysis:

This part of the project we processed the data to get couple of insights such as 1. Daily total users based on the seasonality. 2.
Weekly bike distribution based on temmprature. 3. Hourly wise monthly distributation. At the end there is monthly distribution of total users based on the data.



## Facebook Prophet:

According to the official [website](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/), Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.




## Flask App: 

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.
